As the world & jobs are getting more complex day by day, so online courses, E-books have increased its relevance in the job market as well as for people who want to showcase experience that they have actually worked on the tools listed in job descriptions. 

Even for fresher these days, relevant experience is asked which becomes challenging right? So how come people with experience in industry can sustain now? 

To make your learnings easier and faster I have created E-books and courses which can really help you to gain some realtime experience on working required tools and technologies for SDETs. You can take a look below & refer the courses if required :)

All the best!!
